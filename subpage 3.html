 <SPAN style="font-size:30px;font-family: Caviar Dreams;"> Why is Water so important to athletes? Well, this is because water can help regulates your body temperature and lubricates our joints. It will transport nutrients to give you energy and keep you healthy. 

If all athletes lived without water, their bodies won't be able to perform at their highest level. Even the greatest basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan, won't be able to win 6 rings without water. It is a key factor because, without water, we may feel tired, have muscle cramps, dizziness, or experience other symptoms. </p> </TD> </SPAN>
